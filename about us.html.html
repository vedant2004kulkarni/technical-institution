      <h3> History of college</h3><br>
      <img class="img_deg"src=https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Woe9qWNemw8tk1kUPCYJYwHaEA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180">
A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one.
A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate
or federal university, an institution offering vocational education, a further education 
institution, or a secondary school.
<br>
In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, 
a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not have
university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. 
In the United States, a college may offer undergraduate programs – either as an independent institution
or as the undergraduate program of a university – or it may be a residential college of a university or
a community college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to provide 
affordable and accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees.[1] The word is generally 
also used as a synonym for a university in the US.[2] Colleges in countries such as France, Belgium, and Switzerland 
provide secondary education.

he word "college" is from the Latin verb lego, legere, legi, lectum, "to collect, gather together, pick", plus the preposition cum, "with",
[4] thus meaning "selected together". Thus "colleagues" are literally "persons who have been selected to work together". In ancient Rome a 
collegium was a "body, guild, corporation united in colleagueship; of magistrates, praetors, tribunes, priests, augurs; a political club or 
trade guild".[5] Thus a college was a form of corporation or corporate body, an artificial legal person (body/corpus) with its own legal 
personality, with the capacity to enter into legal contracts, to sue and be sued. In mediaeval England there were colleges of priests, 
for example in chantry chapels; modern survivals include the Royal College of Surgeons in England (originally the Guild of Surgeons 
Within the City of London), the College of Arms in London (a body of heralds enforcing heraldic law), an electoral college (to elect representatives);
 all groups of persons "selected in common" to perform a specified function and appointed by a monarch, founder or other person in authority.
As for the modern "college of education", it was a body created for that purpose, for example Eton College was founded in 1440 by letters
patent of King Henry VI for the constitution of a college of Fellows, priests, clerks, choristers, poor scholars, and old poor men,
 with one master or governor, whose duty it shall be to instruct these scholars and any others who may resort thither from any part of England in the 
 knowledge of letters, and especially of grammar, without payment".[6]
